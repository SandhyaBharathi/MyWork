    <h1 style="background-color:red;">Natural Resources</h1>
    <h3 style="color:Orange;">Definition</h3> <p style="color:deeppink;">Natural resources are materials available on the planet that can be used to keep people alive and meet their needs.

        A natural resource might be any natural substance that humans utilise. This includes oil, coal, natural gas, metals, stone, sand, air, sunlight, soil, and water. Natural resources may also include animals, birds, fish, and vegetation.
        
        Food, fuel, and raw materials for manufacturing are all made from natural resources. Plants and animals provide all of the food that people consume. Heat, light, and power are provided by natural resources such as coal, natural gas, and oil.</p> 
        
    <h3>Different types of Natural Resources</h3> <p><em> Resources can be categorised into two main categories — Renewable and Non-renewable sources of energy.</em></p>
    <h4 style="background-color:green;">Renewable resources</h4> <p><strong> resources are those that are either always available like water, air, and sun or can be replaced or recovered in a reasonable amount of time like vegetative lands. Animals can also be considered renewable since they may produce young ones to replace adult animals.

        Organic renewable resources are renewable resources that originate from living things like trees and animals. Inorganic renewable resources are renewable resources that originate from non-living sources such as water, sunlight, and wind.</strong></p>

    <h4 style="background-color:green;">Non-renewable resources</h4> <p>Non-renewable resources are resources that cant be replenished once theyve been depleted or can not be recovered in a reasonable amount of time. Fossil fuels, and minerals are examples of non-renewable resources because, while they form naturally through a process known as the rock cycle, the process can take thousands of years, making them non-renewable.</p>
    <h2><i>Conservation of Resources</i></h2> <p>Conservation of natural resources is very important as natural resources are essential for human survival, yet not all natural resources are renewable. The tremendous increase in climate change is due to human activity, particularly the usage of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels. By conserving our natural resources, we can have a more positive impact on our natural environment. There are several ways to conserve natural resources in our very own home, such as:

        <br> Use less water – Taking shorter showers and turning off the taps when not in use can <mark>reduce</mark> water wastage.
        <br> Turn off the lights – During the day or when not required, turn off any electronic device. Additionally, LED light bulbs can be used as they consume very less power.
        <br> Walking, using bicycles and sharing vehicles for long distances help in <mark>saving</mark> fuel.
        <br> Use renewable energy – Using solar panels, wind energy, and hydro energy can significantly reduce our dependence and cut back on resource depletion over time.
        <br> Use the three R’s – Reduce, reuse, and recycle.</p>
